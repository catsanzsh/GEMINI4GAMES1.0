int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    if (SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO) != 0) {
        std::cerr << "SDL Initialization Failed: " << SDL_GetError() << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }

    SDL_Window* window = SDL_CreateWindow(
        "GEMINI4GAMES Demo",
        SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
        SDL_WINDOWPOS_CENTERED,
        800,
        600,
        SDL_WINDOW_SHOWN

    if (!window) {
        std::cerr << "Window Creation Failed: " << SDL_GetError() << std::endl;
        SDL_Quit();
        return 1;
